Overview
--------

The FHI-aims User and Developer Meeting will bring together the userbase of FHI-aims with the code developers to explore and discuss the impacts and uses of FHI-aims
within institutions in the UK as well as exhibiting new features and recent developments.

Time and Place
--------------

The meeting is being hosted at `The University of Warwick <https://warwick.ac.uk/>`_ on the **15th - 16th of May 2024**.
The venue is the Science Concourse within the Physics Department. Directions can be found on this `interactive campus map <https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/>`_.

Accommodation and Travel
------------------------

Accommodation options include a limited number of rooms available to be booked on the university campus for attendees through `Warwick Conferences <https://warwick.ac.uk/services/conferences/bed-and-breakfast/>`_
alongside accommodation generally available within Coventry city, a short bus ride from the campus.

Travel to the University of Warwick is achieved easily through rail connections to Coventry station and then a bus journey from outside the station to the campus.
More information about how to get to the university can be found on the `university website <https://warwick.ac.uk/about/visiting/directions/>`_.

Tutorials
---------

This meeting will include a number of tutorials before the main sessions of talks. The topics of these tutorials are ultimately to be driven by what attendees wish to
see tutorials on however there will be a session on the fundamentals of FHI-aims and how best to utilise the software.
Currently suggested topics include a general introduction to FHI-aims, excited state calculations, ASI API or MPE implicit solvation, beyond DFT methods and embedding.
Other, more advanced tutorials will be available and will be published here in due course.

**Full schedule TBA**

Hack
----

After the closing of the main body of the meeting, all attendees are invited to a code hack, wherein the developers of the codebase will get together and take part in some
collaborative coding. The organisers would like to invite anyone with a suggestion for features to be included in FHI-aims to write these into the appropriate box during
the registration process.
